<h1>Take A Guess</h1>

<fieldset>
  <p>Welcome, Agent 0015. Your mission, if you choose to accept, will be to guess a number between 1 and 100. You get 10 tries, if you fail to guess correctly your computer will self destruct.</p>
  <!-- changed guess to more intuitive guessInput -->
  <input type="text" id="guessInput" placeholder=" Guess 1 thru 100 "><br>
  <!-- button elements do not have a declarative type of "button"
       also added the click handler to the guess button 
  -->
<button onclick="checkGuess();">Guess</button>
<button onclick="clearFields();">Reset</button>
